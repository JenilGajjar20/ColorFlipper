# ColorFlipper


Here is the link to see it live: https://jenilgajjar20.github.io/ColorFlipper/

This is a ColorFlipper site made using JavaScript and some BootStrap styling.

Click on (Click Me) button to change the color of the background page.

There are two options given "Simple" and "Hex" in the navbar which means one page contains simple colors and another page contains hexadecimal colors.
